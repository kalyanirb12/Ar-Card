# Augmented Reality (WebAR) based Invitation Cards



Digital card using Augmented Reality

This project introduces a website-based AR Identity Card for college students, leveraging WebAR technology to provide a more interactive and efficient way for students to access multiple services. By scanning the AR-enabled identity card, students can instantly access key features such as:

- Student Location: Real-time location tracking within the campus to navigate easily and find key facilities or class locations.
-Project Repositories: Direct access to all personal and academic project repositories, making it convenient for students to manage and share their work.
- Personal Documents: Secure and quick access to important personal documents like transcripts, certificates, and IDs, all in one place.

This augmented reality solution enhances the traditional ID card by offering instant access to essential services, creating a seamless and engaging experience for students.
